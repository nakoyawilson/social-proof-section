## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

During this project I learned that CSS allows you to add multiple background images for an element. 

```css
.example {
  background-image: url(first_url), url(second_url);
  background-position: right bottom, left top;
  background-repeat: no-repeat, repeat;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [CSS Multiple Backgrounds](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_backgrounds.asp) - This helped me with using multiple background images.
